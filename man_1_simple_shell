.SH DESCRIPTION
The Narita Simple Shell is a simple command line prompt that runs the basics \
commands that are present in the bash shell.  It is the program that is running \
when a user logs into the system. Commands can be typed directly to the running \
shell or can be put into a file and the file can be executed directly by the \
shell. The shell works like the bash and other basic shells.
.PP 
.PP
The NSS have the exact same output as sh (/bin/sh) as well as the exact same \
error output. The only difference is when print an error, the name of the \
program must be equivalent to the argv[0]
.PP
This shell includes two builtins, env and exit (more info below).
.PP
The shell was compiled and tested with gcc, compiled this way: \
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh

.SH INITIALIZATION AND EXAMPLE OF USE
To start to use the Narita Simple Shell the user needs to compile \
using: gcc. Then run the output file by calling ./hsh. 
.PP
.B EX: $ ./hsh\
.PP
After that, you can start to use the basic and useful commands like ls, pwd,\
mv, less, etc.
.PP
This shell works with commands and arguments (if passed) given by the user \
throgh input. It handles all the programs that are in the operating system. \
The syntax is the following: command_name [arguments] This will execute the \
program "command_name" with the given arguments.
.PP

.B EX: $ ls file -la 
.PP

This code will run the program "ls", and it will pass the arguments "file" and \
"-la" to the program.
.PP
.SH EXAMPLE OF NON INTERACTIVE MODE:

.PP
If the user inputs pipelines or calls for non-interactive mode the Narita \
Simple Shell would execute that commands. An example of non-interactive mode \
input:
.PP
.B $ echo 'ls -a' | ./hsh

Another example:
.PP
.B $ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
